# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

Welcome to the "0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO" module! In this module, we'll explore two fundamental data structures: stacks and queues. These data structures play a crucial role in computer science and are essential for various applications and algorithms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the concepts of stacks and queues and their importance in data storage and retrieval.
- Implement and manipulate stacks using the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.
- Implement and manipulate queues using the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle.
- Apply stacks and queues to solve real-world problems and algorithmic challenges.
